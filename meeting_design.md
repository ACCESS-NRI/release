# Meeting design

We want well organised and structured meetings to get the most value from them.

## Principles

Some of the core principles of our meetings

- Capture important information and context for decisions (for ourselves, for our future selves who forget stuff and new staff, and for the community)
- Review and coordinate work by interfacing with GitHub/ZenHub
- Make best use of meeting time

## Design goals

This leads to a some design goals for meetings:

- Everyone is clear how the meetings work, how to contribute agenda items and feedback so we don’t waste time, and new folks can get up to speed quickly
- Disseminate agendas well before meetings
- Agenda items include some background information. This serves three functions: people can decide if they need to attend, allows preparation for more fruitful discussions, eliminates the old “I’ll share the relevant link on slack”, and captures important information that might otherwise need to be recorded in minutes
- Agenda items will have one or more “proposers”, who will be the ones who speak to the item, and the ones to contact before-hand for clarification or if you want to modify or add to the item
- Where possible agenda items should include a desired outcome. This helps to focus the proposer on the purpose of the item, and the discussion can also be more focussed, with a natural end-point when the outcome is achieved.
- Action items should be instantiated as GitHub issues (where possible) and linked in the meeting document
- Brief notes are added during or after the meeting. Who does this isn’t set in stone. It may be proposers are best placed to add notes for their items. All team members should feel free to add their own comments: we don’t always understand the same discussion in the same way
- Subsequent meetings should review outstanding issues from previous meeting. It may also be appropriate to present the results of closed issues for purposes of sharing outputs, or even just acknowledging progress.

The expectation is that pre-meeting preparation is a few minutes to read the agenda and let it percolate so that you can have an informed discussion.

## Platform

Several GitHub options for planning and recording meeting documentation were canvassed (Pull-requests, Wiki, Discussions, Issues), but using issues was decided to be the best option for the following reasons
- Best visibility in ZenHub (can see meeting content without leaving ZenHub)
- Can use labels to filter which meetings appear in workspaces
- Has smart linking like issues/PRs (so better integration with GitHub)
- Simple and straightforward
- Can “close” meetings so not crowded, but can still view old (closed) meetings

The only major drawback is that it is [not simple to download all the issues](https://github.com/community/community/discussions/3315) if we needed to migrate to another platform, or decided to use the information in the issues in some other way.
