# ACCESS-NRI Planning and Strategy

This repository is used internally by [ACCESS-NRI][access-nri] to plan team meetings and organise work schedules.

[Issues][issue] are used to document meetings, including agendas and meeting notes. This repository does not host any code. 

See the [notes on meeting design](meeting_design.md) for more background information on the meeting design and platform choice.

## Fornightly Team Meetings

Meetings run from 1.30-2.30pm every second week, alternating between Release Management and Model Development

### How to run the meeting

Create an [issue] for the next meeting. For the subject follow the naming convention for the previous meeting.

Each agenda item has a title, the team members who proposed it, and will speak to it, and a description of the agenda item with some background information. Remember, if it is important enough to bring to a meeting, it is important enough to spend a small amount of time documenting why. This also adds value to the meeting: attendees can come prepared, and important information is captured. It also allows other members of the team to know if this is a meeting they need to attend. Ideally each agenda item should also contain a brief statement of the desired outcome. This is useful for the proposer: why am I asking for this to be part of the meeting and what end result do I need. This also helps attendees understand the scope of the discussion, and know when the objective has been achieved.

The issue should be created before the meeting. Ideally with enough work time for others to suggest additional agenda items, or changes to existing items. For Monday meetings this is ideally no later than Friday morning. 

Notes can be added during or immediately after the meeting. Notes should include references to issues that are spawned as action items from the meeting.

At this point another team member who attended the meeting should be asked to review to double check notes faithfully capture what happened in the meeting, and action items are correctly included, and assigned where appropriate.
