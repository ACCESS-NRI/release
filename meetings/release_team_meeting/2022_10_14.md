# ACCESS-NRI Release Meeting 24/10/2002

## Agenda 

### Style guide
#### Proposers: @RogerEdberg @harshula
We have already seen the need for a style guide at ACCESS-NRI, to obviate the need for tedious style choices, or worse taking extra time to check how this was done in the past (which is error prone and time consuming). We recognise there is a lot of legacy code and documentation with existing style conventions. The style guide should represent an ideal, recognising resource constraints will prevent this being universally retrospectively applied.

Some useful links:

- [Google style guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/)
- [Pawsey style and branding guide](https://pawsey.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PawseyBrandStyleGuideWeb.pdf)

### Definitions
#### Proposers: @aidanheerdegen @kdruken
For this meeting to work effectively we need specific shared targets to focus activities and reporting. This requires good definitions of what constitutes products, releases, etc and their minimum viable products.  

The intention is to give an overview of current thinking, with most feedback to be incorporated in a [PR on the procedures and practices website][PR-18].
