# Fornightly Team Meeting 

Meetings run from 1.30-2.30pm every second week.

## How to run the meeting

Create a new document for the next meeting in this directory. It should be named YYYY_MM_DD.md where the date is numerals and YYYY is year, MM is month, and DD is day.

The easiest way to get a consistent format is to copy the previous one to the new location and edit it. Each agenda item has a title, the team members who proposed it, and will speak to it, and a description of the agenda item with some background information. Remember, if it is important enough to bring to a meeting, it is important enough to spend some time documenting why. This also adds value to the meeting: attendees can come prepared, and important information is captured. 

The document should be added as a PR to the repository before the meeting. Ideally with enough time for others to suggest additional agenda items, or changes to existing items. 

Notes can be added during or immediately after the meeting and pushed to the PR. Notes should include references to issues that are spawned as action items from the meeting.

At this point team another team member who attended the meeting should be asked to review to double check notes faithfully capture what happened in the meeting, and action items are correctly included, and assigned where appropriate. Then the PR can be merged.
